      Chapter 3: The Crossroads - The Guardian's Vigil
    </h2>

    <p class="header-general header-tiny">
      Faced with the daunting presence of the immense worm-like guardian, you
      hesitate to confront the creature. The danger posed by the creature,
      coupled with the unknown consequences of a blood transfusion, leads you to
      reconsider your decision. Instead of challenging the guardian or
      attempting the risky ritual, you choose to turn away from the River of
      Pure Blood and the dark temptation it represents. The allure of the power
      it could provide is enticing, but you decide to resist, adhering to your
      knightly code and your sense of honor. Leaving the guardian and the river
      behind, you return to the kingdom, still afflicted by the Dragonblight but
      with your integrity intact. Though the curse continues to transform you,
      you remain true to your noble ideals, valiantly defending the realm and
      its people.
