        >You decide to embark on a quest to find a legendary relic known as the
        "Elixir of Draconic Purity." The legend states that this ancient
        artifact can cure even the most potent of curses, including
        Dragonblight. As you gather information, you learn that the Elixir is
        said to be hidden deep within the treacherous Dragon's Breath Mountains,
        a place only the bravest and most skilled adventurers dare to venture.
        Despite the odds, your determination and knightly skills lead you to the
        heart of the Dragon's Breath Mountains. There, in a hidden cavern, you
        find the Elixir of Draconic Purity, a shimmering liquid in a vial. To
        access it, you must confront a guardian, a majestic but ancient dragon
        who has been guarding the relic for centuries. The dragon challenges
        you, questioning your motives and testing your resolve. You must
        convince the dragon of your noble intentions and engage in a battle of
        wits.
