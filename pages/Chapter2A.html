        Sanctum where the healers and alchemists reside. They inform you that
        you are indeed afflicted with Dragonblight. Though it is a known disease
        from ancient times, it is unheard of for an individual to catch it in
        this era. They tell you that there is no known cure for this disease,
        one shall have to make their own.
