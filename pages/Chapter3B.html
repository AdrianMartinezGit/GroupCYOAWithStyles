        >Fascinated by the allure of dark magics and the potential for a swift
        resolution to your affliction, you decide to experiment with the
        esoteric spells and mix ingredients youâ€™ve found in the ruins. You begin
        to practice these forbidden arts and combine various ingredients found
        within the archives to create an elixir that you hope will cure the
        disease. However, as you continue to delve deeper into the dark arts and
        use these ancient formulas, your attempt to create a cure yields only
        vile elixirs, unsafe for consumption. Your trials proved fruitless, and
        the concoctions you produce are more destructive than curative. Each
        failure takes a toll on your physical and mental state. The blight
        persists, and the transformation only becomes more painful as what feels
        like horns begin to grow from your head. Desperate to find a solution,
        you continue to search within the Forbidden Archives, searching for a
        more refined formula that might reverse the effects of the Dragonblight.
        Your journey within the realm of the dark magics takes a perilous turn
        as you uncover a potential remedy that could relieve you from the
        blight.
