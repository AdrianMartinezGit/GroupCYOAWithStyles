      Chapter 4: The Crossroads - Swallowed by The Earthshaker
    </h2>

    <p class="header-general header-small">
      You take a deep breath, relieved that the danger has passed, and turn away
      from the River of Pure Blood, still unsure about the consequences of the
      blood transfusion. However, as you begin to make your retreat, the ground
      beneath you quakes once more. The Earthshaker resurfaces with incredible
      force and speed. Its gaping maw closes around you, and you find yourself
      consumed by the colossal creature. Your valiant attempt to escape results
      in being swallowed whole by the beast, sealing your fate in its depths.
