      Chapter 4: The Crossroads - The Ascension of The Dragon King
    </h2>

    <p class="header-general header-small">
      Using the more refined formula you’ve found within the Forbidden Archives,
      you attempt to create an elixir that will rid you of Dragonblight. Your
      determination is unwavering and you combine the newfound knowledge and
      ingredients with care and precision. The elixir you create, however, does
      not cure the disease as you had hoped. Instead, it triggers a
      transformation unlike any other. Your body contorts, scales and wings
      sprout, and you become a true, terrifying beast, known as The Dragon King.
      The ancient dragons, sensing your newfound power, bow to you, recognizing
      you as their ruler. With immense power at your disposal, you set out on a
      rampage of destruction, leaving devastation in your wake. The seven great
      kingdoms and their lands fall before your might, and you become a force to
      be feared throughout the realm. The once venerable dragon slayer is no
      more. During the transformation you’ve lost yourself, nothing remains of
      who you once were, as your body is now a vassal for The Dragon God.
