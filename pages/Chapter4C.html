      Chapter 4: The Crossroads - The Corrupted Vessel
    </h2>

    <p class="header-general header-small">
      As you stand at the edge of the River of The Pure Blood, You begin the
      transfusion process with trepidation, feeling the intense power of the
      river’s dark blood as it courses through your veins. However, the results
      are far from the cure you had envisioned. The blood transfusion doesn’t
      flush out the Dragonblight, but instead exacerbates your transformation
      into a horrific draconic being. The ritual that was meant to cleanse your
      blood and cure the Dragonblight has instead backfired in the most
      horrifying way. A searing pain courses through your body as your
      transformation intensifies. Your skin racks, revealing grotesque scales
      beneath, and your limbs contort into a monstrous form. Your very essence
      is consumed by the Dragonblight, and your humanity is lost. Though instead
      of becoming a harbinger of chaos, you find yourself overtaken by an even
      darker force. The ancient dragons seize control of your mind and body.
      Bound to the ancient dragons’ will, you become a relentless agent of their
      destruction. With no control over your actions, you unleash havoc upon the
      land, leaving destruction and despair in your wake. The seven great
      kingdoms fall before your nightmarish might, and the realm is plunged into
      a new era of darkness and fear.
