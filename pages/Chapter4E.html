      Chapter 4: The Crossroads - The Curse Unleashed
    </h2>

    <p class="header-general header-tiny">
      Despite your determination and courage, you fail to convince the ancient
      dragon of your noble intentions. The dragon, mistrustful of humanity,
      remains resolute in its belief that the Elixir of Draconic Purity should
      remain hidden from the world. It unleashes its wrath upon you, and a
      fierce battle ensues. In the end, you are no match for the ancient
      dragon's power. The battle is fierce, and the dragon ultimately defeats
      you, sealing your fate. You are left to endure the worsening effects of
      the Dragonblight, which continue to transform you into a draconic being.
      With each passing day, your humanity erodes, and you become a terrifying
      beast, feared by all. You no longer have control over your actions,
      becoming a monstrous force of destruction. The ancient dragons recognize
      you as one of their own, and you join their ranks as a creature of
      darkness, forever lost to humanity.
