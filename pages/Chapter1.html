        >You are a renowned dragon slaying knight, celebrated throughout the
        kingdom of Ishar Vadhal for your valor and heroism. One fateful day, you
        challenge an ancient dragon who rose from the Rotting Vale. This dragon
        is quite different from the others, as rather than a breath of flames,
        from its mouth comes a cloud of miasma. With no way to anticipate and
        avoid this attack, you inhale the noxious fumes. Now weakened, you
        manage to force the dragon to retreat, unable to slay it. Rather than
        retreating back to the vale, it flies off. The beast now roams the
        lands, but that is the least of your worries. You discover that you have
        contracted a strange, ancient disease known as Dragonblight. Slowly, you
        are transforming into a horrific draconic being. You feel the scales
        beginning to force their way out from under your skin. Razor sharp,
        serrated teeth pierce through your gums.
