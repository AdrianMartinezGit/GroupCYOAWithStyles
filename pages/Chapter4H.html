      Chapter 4: The Crossroads - The Lost Knight
    </h2>

    <hr>

    <p class="header-general header-tiny">
      Despite your valiant efforts, the Draconic Trials prove too challenging.
      You struggle with each trial, facing overwhelming odds and fearsome
      adversaries. The Order of the Draconic Guardians, bound by their ancient
      traditions, can't offer assistance to one who couldn't meet their
      stringent requirements. Defeated and with the Dragonblight's
      transformation worsening, you return to the kingdom in despair. The curse
      continues to consume you, and the noble knight you once were fades away.
      You wander the lands, a tragic figure, no longer human and no longer
      revered. Your name is forgotten, and your tale becomes a somber legend,
      serving as a reminder of the perils that befell you.
