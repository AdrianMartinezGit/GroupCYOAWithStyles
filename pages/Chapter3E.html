        >You travel to the Order of the Draconic Guardians, a secretive
        organization that has guarded ancient knowledge related to dragons for
        centuries. They agree to help you, but they propose a series of trials
        that you must pass to prove your worthiness. These trials are grueling
        tests of your physical and mental abilities, designed to prepare you for
        the transformation into a draconic being.
