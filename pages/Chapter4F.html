      Chapter 4: The Crossroads - Unintended Consequences
    </h2>

    <p class="header-general header-small">
      You agree to explore the less ethical options the healer mentioned,
      leading you to a hidden chamber filled with ancient, forbidden texts and
      relics. Among these artifacts, you find a vial of dark, mysterious elixir.
      The healer explains that it is rumored to have the power to halt the
      progression of the Dragonblight, but its origins are shrouded in secrecy.
      Desperation drives you to consume the elixir in the hope of halting the
      Dragonblight's transformation. As you drink the dark liquid, you feel an
      immediate but temporary relief from the affliction. The scales cease to
      spread, and your transformation stalls. However, the elixir's side effects
      soon become apparent. Your body begins to convulse, and the newfound power
      it granted you is unstable and uncontrollable. You become a danger to
      those around you. The healer, horrified by the consequences of your
      choice, informs you that there is no known way to reverse the side effects
      of the elixir. Isolated and feared, you must now grapple with the burden
      of your actions and the irreversible consequences of your choice. This
      ending leaves you in a state of uncertainty, dealing with the fallout of
      your decision to resort to unethical means in your quest for a cure.
