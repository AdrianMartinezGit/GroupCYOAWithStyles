      Chapter 4: The Crossroads - The Noble Dragon Knight
    </h2>

    <p class="header-general header-small">
      You undergo the grueling Draconic Trials with unwavering determination and
      resolve. These trials push you to your limits, testing your physical and
      mental prowess. After a series of harrowing tests, you emerge victorious,
      proving your worthiness to the Order of the Draconic Guardians. Impressed
      by your dedication and valor, the Order bestows upon you their ancient
      knowledge and a potent remedy known as the "Scaleborne Elixir." With their
      guidance, you craft the elixir that successfully reverses the effects of
      the Dragonblight. You return to the kingdom as a revered and powerful
      figure, a unique blend of noble knight and formidable dragon. Your legend
      grows as you protect the realm with your newfound abilities, bringing hope
      and awe to the people.
