      Chapter 4: The Crossroads - The Abyss Beckons
    </h2>

    <p class="header-general header-small">
      In your relentless pursuit of a cure within the Forbidden Archives, you
      become consumed by the allure of dark magic. The arcane knowledge and
      forbidden spells begin to unravel your sense of morality and ethics. As
      you delve deeper into the dark arts, you start losing control over your
      actions and your own humanity. The refined formula you seek becomes
      elusive, and you find yourself on a dangerous and self-destructive path.
      Your obsession with dark magic and your desire to cure the Dragonblight at
      any cost lead to the creation of increasingly dangerous and unpredictable
      elixirs. Each attempt brings you closer to the brink of madness. Your body
      continues to transform, growing more monstrous and draconic, as your mind
      becomes clouded by the dark arts. You lose touch with your former self,
      and the blight gains an unshakable hold over you. The transformation is
      irreversible, and you become a creature of darkness, driven by a thirst
      for power and vengeance.
