        >You journey into the region where pure blood and vile blood is thought
        to have originated from, large deep red crystals protrude from the
        ground as you follow an unnatural tunnel going deep underground with
        more of these crystals. As you venture deeper into the heart of
        darkness, you encounter desolate landscapes and ominous creatures that
        seem to guard the secrets of the River of The Pure Blood. The atmosphere
        becomes increasingly oppressive, and the very air feels tainted with
        malevolent energy. Upon arriving at the riverâ€™s sinister banks, you
        discover that the river runs thick with Pure Blood, unnaturally gleaming
        under a dim, foreboding sky. The temptation to undergo a blood
        transfusion in the hope of flushing out the Dragonblight is immense, but
        the ritual itself is shrouded in mystique and danger. Your thoughts are
        interrupted by an immense earthquake as a giant worm-like creature
        erupts from the ground. Its sheer size is larger than most dragons with
        what seems to be only a slight fraction of its body exposed. The
        creature is now between you and the River of Pure Blood, blocking your
        path. It seems to be guarding the river as it awaits your next move.
