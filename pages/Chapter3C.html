        >You challenge the beast, but with each earth-shaking movement and
        attempt to approach the River of Pure Blood, the creature tunnels
        through the ground, causing powerful earthquakes that threaten to
        swallow you whole. The ground trembles, rocks crumble, and chasms open,
        making every step treacherous. The battle with this colossal creature is
        a test of your resolve and power. It becomes clear that you will be
        unable to slay it, you must force the beast to retreat in order to reach
        the river. As the creature lunges toward you with its immense maw, your
        draconic transformation reaches a critical point. In a moment of
        desperation, part of your transformation manifests as a powerful fire
        breath, which you unleash upon the creature. The scorching flames engulf
        the creature, causing it to writhe in agony and retreat into the depths
        of the earth. Though it retreated, you feel as if you did not do any
        real damage to the creature. This causes you to worry, for now you must
        act quickly before the creature returns.
