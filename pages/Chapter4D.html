      Chapter 4: The Crossroads - The Noble Knight's Redemption
    </h2>

    <p class="header-general header-small">
      After a grueling battle of wits and valor, you manage to convince the
      ancient dragon of your noble intentions. The dragon, impressed by your
      unwavering determination and your willingness to face both the physical
      and moral trials, willingly hands over the Elixir of Draconic Purity. As
      you take the vial in your hands, you feel an immense surge of hope. You
      return to the Inner Sanctum with the Elixir in your possession. The
      healers and alchemists analyze the ancient remedy and, with their
      knowledge and skills, they refine it to create a powerful cure for the
      Dragonblight. The transformation is reversed, and you return to your
      former self, no longer plagued by the curse.
