        >You travel to the tunnel leading to The Rotten Vale, created by the
        ancient dragon that has afflicted you. Upon entering the Vale, you are
        confronted with the sight of grotesque creatures and the overwhelming
        stench of decay. The air is thick with a cloud of miasma, and an eerie
        silence, broken only by the occasional sounds of the terrifying
        creatures that lurk deep within. This is a place that has been shunned
        and feared for centuries. As you navigate the treacherous terrain, you
        eventually discover the ruins of an ancient archive. The scrolls and
        manuscripts you find are filled with esoteric symbols, cryptic
        incantations, and detailed accounts of curses and afflictions that have
        plagued humanity throughout history. The knowledge contained within
        these texts is profound and unsettling, as it offers a glimpse into the
        dark arts of curses and their potential remedies. Before committing, you
        pick up a dusty scroll containing the whereabouts of the ancient,
        mystical Order of the Draconic Guardians. You wonder if they will hold
        the answers you seek. You stop for a moment to think as you now consider
        your choices.
